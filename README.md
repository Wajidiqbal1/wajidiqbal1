## Hi there 👋
- I'm a computational biologist (sort of) working on genomics.
- I especially enjoy playing around with WES, bulk, and single-cell RNA-seq data by applying different workflows and scripts.
- I primarily use R for data wrangling and visualization within the tidyverse ecosystem.
- Although I've never used Python for any projects so far, it’s definitely on my to-do list.
- I’m an intermediate-level user of Unix and still pick up new shell tricks almost every month.
- I also have a great interest in promoting open science and reforming bioinformatics education.
  😄 Pronouns: he/him
