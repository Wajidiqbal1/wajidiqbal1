## Part1:

Welcome to the first blog in our series on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In this series, we will explore the fascinating world of scRNA-seq, from its basics to advanced analysis techniques. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding, this series is designed to guide you through the complexities of scRNA-seq.

## **Cell being the building block of life:**

Life, as we know it, is the characteristics that differentiate living from non-living things. Almost all form of life on earth shares a similar identity at microscopic level that we called, **Cells**. I am sure that all of you would have studied the famous **Cell Theory** in your School (with some modern interpretation) that says:

-   All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
-   Cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
-   All cells arise from pre-existing cells.
-   The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells.
-   Energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells.
-   Cells contain DNA which is found specifically in the chromosome and RNA found in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.
-   All cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.

## **Why Single Cell ?**

Complex Biology give rise to complex system, where each component of the system works in a coordinated fashion to their own special role in order to be as important as others. Before the advent of single-cell techniques we were only able to understand and analyze cell-averaged expression profile which was good but were unable to answer certain questions:

-   cell-to-cell differences were missing.
-   cellular heterogeneity completely masked.

Now with single cell one can draw a comparison not only at inter-tumor but at intra-tumor level which was not possible in case of Bulk-rnaseq. Scrna-seq based studies can be used to:

-   explore which cell types are present in a tissue (Cellular Heterogeneity)

-   Identify unknown/rare cell types or states

-   Elucidate the changes in gene expression during differentiation processes or across time or states

-   Identify genes that are differentially expressed in particular cell types between conditions (e.g. treatment or disease or treated vs untreated)

-   Explore changes in expression among a cell type while incorporating spatial, regulatory, and/or protein information

## **Challenges with scRNA-seq Analysis:**

Bulk rna-seq works perfectly well if your analysis involves comparing average-cellular expression between two different conditions. Similarly it also has potential for the discovery of disease biomarkers if you are **not expecting or not concerned about cellular heterogeneity **in the sample. Howerver, scrna-seq with its revolutioninzig capabilities to uncover cellular heterogeneity aslo has some challenges associated with it.

-   Experiment is costly.

-   Library preparation is dificult.

-   Analysis of the data is complicated.

-   Difficult to interpret data compare to bulk rna-seq analysis.

-   Large volume of data

-   Low depth of sequencing per cell

-   Technical variability across cells/samples

-   Biological variability across cells/samples

More on these challenges in the next blog post which will be part 2 of this series.
