    "text": "Hi there! I’m wajid iqbal. I love Bioinformatics and R programming language. But guess what? I have recently fallen for something new—Quarto! That’s right, it’s what made me build this website.When I’m not busy in the lab or with my code, I like to run. Inspired by the ultra-marathon legend David Goggins, I tackle a tough challenge at my university’s football ground—17 rounds, and each round is 500 meters. As Goggins would put it, ‘Who’s gonna carry the boat son?’ Well, in my case, it’s me pushing those laps!”"

    "text": "“I’m a computational biologist (sort of) working on genomics, and I especially enjoys playing around with WES, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data by applying different workflows and scripts on it. I primarily use R for data wrangling and visualization within the tidyverse ecosystem. Although I’ve never used Python for any projects so far, it’s definitely on my to-do list. I’m an intermediate-level user of Unix and still pick up new shell tricks almost every month. I also have a great interest in promoting open science and reforming bioinformatics education.\nMy background is in Biotechnology and Human Genetics. I never imagined that I would switch to a coding-centric Path. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology at International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan in 2021 and am about to finish my master’s degree there as well. I am passionate about all aspects of bioinformatics and data science. Up until 2020, I didn’t even have a laptop, which made things more challenging. During my undergraduate studies, I received an F grade in an “Introduction to Bioinformatics course” because I knew nothing about matrix creation; I thought of it as a puzzle involving algorithms like Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman. Moreover, my mathematics skills were weak from the start—I used to memorize math questions in school just to pass tests. However, everything changed in 2021 when I attended a workshop on transcriptomics using R. Initially, I was completely terrified of anything related to data, coding, or data science, but thanks to a super supportive community, especially my supervisor Dr. Asif Mir, and some excellent colleagues specifically Dr.Abrar Hussain and Human Molecular Genetics Lab,IIUI, I am finding my path in Bioinformatics and Data Science Education and i am absolutely loving it.”"

It consists of several R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work seamlessly together.\n\n\nThe Tidyverse includes several key packages, each tailored for specific data science tasks:\nggplot2 for data visualization, which allows for the creation of complex plots from a data frame with a powerful and flexible system. dplyr for data manipulation, offering a concise syntax for transforming and summarizing data sets. tidyr for tidying data, ensuring that it is in a form that is easy to work with and analyze. readr for importing data, providing a fast and friendly way to read tabular data into R.\n\n\n\nThe philosophy of the Tidyverse is centered around tidy data and expressive coding. It emphasizes clarity and simplicity in syntax, enabling users to write code that is easy to read and understand at a glance. This is particularly evident in the consistent and intuitive way each package handles data operations.\n\n\n\nUtilizing the Tidyverse enhances productivity and facilitates more efficient data analysis processes. It simplifies many common tasks in data analysis and provides a coherent system that R users, from beginners to experts, can easily adopt.\n\n\n\nThe Tidyverse is more than just a collection of R packages.

Almost all form of life on earth shares a similar identity at microscopic level that we called, Cells. I am sure that all of you would have studied the famous Cell Theory in your School (with some modern interpretation) that says:\n\nAll living organisms are composed of one or more cells.\nCell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.\nAll cells arise from pre-existing cells.\nThe activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells.\nEnergy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs within cells.\nCells contain DNA which is found specifically in the chromosome and RNA found in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.\nAll cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Robert Hooke’s illustration of cork cells from his book Micrographia."

    "text": "Why Single Cell ?\nComplex Biology give rise to complex system, where each component of the system works in a coordinated fashion to their own special role in order to be as important as others. Before the advent of single-cell techniques we were only able to understand and analyze cell-averaged expression profile which was good but were unable to answer certain questions:\n\ncell-to-cell differences were missing.\ncellular heterogeneity completely masked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Flowchart of comparison of Bulk and Single cell-rnaseq\n\n\nNow with single cell one can draw a comparison not only at inter-tumor but at intra-tumor level which was not possible in case of Bulk-rnaseq. Scrna-seq based studies can be used to:\n\nexplore which cell types are present in a tissue (Cellular Heterogeneity)\nIdentify unknown/rare cell types or states\nElucidate the changes in gene expression during differentiation processes or across time or states\nIdentify genes that are differentially expressed in particular cell types between conditions (e.g. treatment or disease or treated vs untreated)\nExplore changes in expression among a cell type while incorporating spatial, regulatory, and/or protein information"

Similarly it also has potential for the discovery of disease biomarkers if you are not expecting or not concerned about cellular heterogeneity in the sample. Howerver, scrna-seq with its revolutioninzig capabilities to uncover cellular heterogeneity aslo has some challenges associated with it.\n\nExperiment is costly.\nLibrary preparation is dificult.\nAnalysis of the data is complicated.\nDifficult to interpret data compare to bulk rna-seq analysis.\nLarge volume of data\nLow depth of sequencing per cell\nTechnical variability across cells/samples\nBiological variability across cells/samples More on these challenges in the next blog post which will be part 2 of this series."
