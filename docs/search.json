    "text": "üòï Have you ever wondered what this statement means ‚ÄúP-value was less than 0.05 hence the results are significant‚Äù? For researchers, this seemingly simple number holds more weight than you might imagine. Let‚Äôs dive into why this tiny value is so crucial in scientific studies. I am writing this post for my own future reference but if it can help someone else, then the reason for writing it will be fulfilled. P-Value is a common statistical term and i thought i had a clear understanding of it but it turns out that the language in which it is normally described can be misleading and often results in the wrong interpretation.\nLets ask a very simple question and try to understand what a p value is:\nSuperVeggie or Apple or any other Juice is claimed to improve energy levels. In a recent study, participants who drank SuperVeggie Juice showed a 3 times increase in their energy levels compared to those who drank water (p &lt; 0.05, 95% CI 2.0-4.0).\nü§îCan you tell which statements above are true or false?\nThe answer is ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ none of the statements above are true. If you are not sure why, hopefully this post will clear things up.\nBefore going into why the above statements are wrong and how they means different than what you thought lets describe a few other concepts related to it and then we will come back to it."

    "section": "Hypothesis:",
    "text": "Hypothesis:\nA research hypothesis is a hypothesis that¬†is used to test the relationship between two or more variables. For example, Does drug A has an effect on B or vice versa.\nLet say we are interested in finding out whether superveggie juice increase the energy level or not compared to water.\nIn other words (statistical words) this would be phrased as:\nH0 (null hypothesis):¬†There is no significant difference in energy levels between the group that drank SuperVeggie Juice and the group that drank water. Or, the average energy levels of the SuperVeggie Juice group - the average energy levels of the water group = 0.\nH1 (alternative hypothesis): There is a significant difference in energy levels between the group that drank SuperVeggie Juice and the group that drank water. Or, the average energy levels of the SuperVeggie Juice group - the average energy levels of the water group ‚â† 0.\nSo now it‚Äôs time to test the effectiveness of SuperVeggie Juice!\nInstead of testing every single person in the world, we select a sample of 100 people who drank SuperVeggie Juice and 100 people who drank water.\nThe mean energy level increase for the SuperVeggie Juice group is 3 points. The mean energy level increase for the water group is 2 points. What we are actually testing is the difference in means. Based on our sample data, we obtain a 95% confidence interval between 0.5 and 1.7 points, and a p-value of 0.02.\nIn summary:\n\np-value = 0.02\nCI (confidence interval) = [0.5, 1.7]\nCL (confidence level) = 95%\n\nWe decide to use a p-value threshold of 0.05. Since our p-value is less than 0.05, our results are significant. We can accept the alternative hypothesis (that there are significant differences in energy levels between the two groups) and reject the null hypothesis.\nWohoo!\nSo‚Ä¶ what does this actually mean?"

    "text": "What are p-values?\nA p-value is¬†the probability of obtaining the result you got‚Äîor an even more extreme one‚Äîif the null hypothesis is correct, simply put it tells us how likely it is that we would see the results we got, if there was actually no effect.\nIn our SuperVeggie Juice example, a p-value tells us how likely it is that we would see the energy boost we observed if SuperVeggie Juice actually does nothing at all.\n\nA p-value of 0.02 means there is a 2% chance that we would observe the energy level increase (or even a larger increase) we saw if SuperVeggie Juice actually has no effect.\nIn simple terms, if SuperVeggie Juice did nothing, there‚Äôs only a 2% chance that the difference in energy levels (between the juice group and the water group) would be this big just by random luck.\nIn other words, if SuperVeggie Juice had no effect on energy levels, there is a 2% chance of taking 100 people who drank the juice and 100 people who drank water, averaging their energy level increases, subtracting the means, and getting a difference of 1 point or more.\n\nThis brings us to the most common misconception of p-values. Read the following statement carefully, and decide if it is true or false:\nWith a p-value threshold of 5%, we are accepting that there is a 5% probability that there actually is no significant difference between groups.\nWhat do you think?\nThe truth is‚Ä¶ it is FALSE!\nwe define p-value as something that tells us how likely it is that we would see the results we got, if there was actually no effect. With a p-value threshold of 5%, we are accepting a 5% probability of obtaining those results if there are no differences between groups. The ‚Äòtrick‚Äô here is that the p-value does not tell you if H0 is correct or incorrect. It just tells you how probable it is that you got the results you got, if H0 were correct. The smaller the p-value, the more improbable it is that you got those results if H0 were correct, in other words. Often we take a ‚Äòshortcut‚Äô and say ‚Äòp &lt; 0.05 ‚Äì we reject the null hypothesis and assume there‚Äôs a 5% chance that it is actually correct‚Äô. But this is wrong, because the p-value does not inform whether H0 is correct or incorrect, it informs about the probability of obtaining those results from our sample, if H0 were true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value is NOT the probability that the null hypothesis is true, or the probability that the alternative hypothesis is false.\nThe p-value is not the probability that the observed effects were produced by random chance alone.\nThe p-value is the probability of obtaining the result you got‚Äîor an even more extreme one‚Äîif the null hypothesis is correct.\n\n\n\nIn Summary a p-value helps us understand the likelihood of our results under the null hypothesis, not the likelihood of the hypothesis itself being true or false."

Instead, it tells us that if SuperVeggie Juice had no effect, there is less than a 5% chance we would see these results by random chance alone.\nCorrect statement: ‚ÄúThere is strong evidence that SuperVeggie Juice improves energy levels, with a less than 5% chance that these results are due to random chance.\nThere‚Äôs a 95% chance that SuperVeggie Juice increases energy levels by 2 to 4 times.\nWhy it‚Äôs wrong: The 95% confidence interval means that if we repeated the study many times, 95% of the time, the true increase in energy levels would fall between 2 and 4 times. It does not mean there‚Äôs a 95% chance for the specific study result.\nCorrect statement: We are 95% confident that SuperVeggie Juice increases energy levels between 2 and 4 times.\nThere‚Äôs a 95% chance that SuperVeggie Juice actually works.\nWhy it‚Äôs wrong: The confidence interval and p-value do not give the probability that SuperVeggie Juice works. They show evidence of an effect and the range of possible increases in energy levels.\nCorrect statement: The study shows strong evidence that SuperVeggie Juice works, and we are confident the true increase in energy levels is between 2 and 4 times."

I completed my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Biotechnology at International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan in 2021 and am about to finish my master‚Äôs degree there as well. I am passionate about all aspects of bioinformatics and data science. Up until 2020, I didn‚Äôt even have a laptop, which made things more challenging. During my undergraduate studies, I received an F grade in an ‚ÄúIntroduction to Bioinformatics course‚Äù because I knew nothing about matrix creation; I thought of it as a puzzle involving algorithms like Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman. Moreover, my mathematics skills were weak from the start‚ÄîI used to memorize math questions in school just to pass tests. However, everything changed in 2021 when I attended a workshop on transcriptomics using R. Initially, I was completely terrified of anything related to data, coding, or data science, but thanks to a super supportive community, especially my supervisor Dr.¬†Asif Mir, and some excellent colleagues specifically Dr.Abrar Hussain and Human Molecular Genetics Lab,IIUI, I am finding my path in Bioinformatics and Data Science Education and i am absolutely loving it.‚Äù"

UMIs are randomly synthesized sequences, typically between 8 and 12 base pairs in length, depending on the technology and its version, providing over 50,000 possible combinations(Archer et al. 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible combination with 8 and 12 bp:\n\n\n\nSince there are 4 nucleotides (A, T, C, G)\nFor a UMI of 8 base pairs, there are 4^8 (65,536) possible combinations. For 12 base pairs, the number of combinations is 4^12(16,777,216).\n\n\nTheoretically, each mRNA molecule would have a unique barcode. However, in practice, randomness in synthesis does not guarantee equal probability for all sequences, leading to biases in UMI distribution. To address this, we combine the UMI with the genomic location of the mRNA transcript to uniquely identify captured mRNA molecules.\nAdditionally, we incorporate a cell barcode, a sequence between 14 and 18 base pairs, the number varies with the technology used. These barcodes are deliberately generated from predetermined pools, ensuring each barcode differs by at least two base pairs from any other to allow for error correction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore explanation on barcodes:\n\n\n\nWhen we design barcodes to identify each cell, we make sure every barcode is different from every other barcode by at least two letters. This way, even if there‚Äôs a small mistake in reading the barcode (like reading an ‚ÄòA‚Äô as a ‚ÄòT‚Äô), we can still tell which cell it‚Äôs supposed to be from. If two barcodes are only one letter different, we assume the difference is just a mistake and group them together as coming from the same cell. This helps us correct for small errors and ensures we correctly identify each cell.\n\n\nSequencing errors can occur, and having such errors in cell barcodes could misassign reads to incorrect cell types, such as assigning a read from a T-cell to an endothelial cell. The two base pair differences between barcodes enable us to aggregate barcodes with single base pair differences, treating them as sequencing errors, and ensuring they all originated from the same cell (Aird et al. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on UMI and barcodes\n\n\n\nUMIs are used to identify and quantify individual RNA molecules within a single cell. They help correct for biases introduced during the amplification process (such as PCR) by allowing the differentiation between true biological duplicates and duplicates introduced during amplification. When an RNA molecule is captured and converted to cDNA, a unique sequence (UMI) is attached to it. This UMI allows researchers to count the original number of RNA molecules more accurately because even if the molecule is amplified multiple times, it will still have the same UMI.\nWhile cell barcodes are used to identify which cell an RNA molecule came from and essential for distinguish RNA molecule from different cells. Each cell in the experiment is tagged with a unique barcode before sequencing and then this barcode is added to all the RNA molecules captured from that particular cell.\n\n\nKnowing the predetermined pool of barcode sequences is essential for accurate identification and error correction in our analysis.We need to be aware of the specific pool of barcodes used. For example, if you are using the 10X Genomics Chromium system, 10X genomics barcode whitelist you can visit their website to identify the version you are using and download the corresponding whitelist of barcodes.Below shown in Figure¬†3 is whitelist corresponding to different chemistry of 10X Genomics with its bp as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Whitelist of the barcodes for 10X chromium system\n\n\n\nIf you are using a different technology, you will need to locate the appropriate whitelist of barcodes for that system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that barcode lengths and sequences can vary between versions, so it is crucial to ensure you have the correct one. the good thing is that cell-Ranger pipeline has most of these built in and will automatically try and guess which white list you‚Äôre using but it‚Äôs always preferable to know ahead of time and tell it the right one so that you have 0% chance of it guessing the wrong one.\n\n\nAfter barcodes, the next step is PCR Amplification, We then obtain our PCR primers, which are use to extensively amplify our mRNA molecules, increasing their quantity from picograms to nanograms or more for our sequencing libraries. Once hybridized, a reverse transcriptase primer is also attached, enabling reverse transcription to begin and generate a cDNA strand from the mRNA. This process includes adding a series of cytosines (C‚Äôs) at the end of the cDNA. A switch oligo is then added, which hybridizes to these poly-C tails and provides a primer for reverse transcriptase to synthesize the second strand of cDNA as shown in Figure¬†2.\nAfterward, we have our cDNA with PCR primers, which we can amplify. We perform the amplification through 12 to 15 PCR cycles. Any inefficiencies or noise in the PCR process are also amplified, which is why we use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). UMIs help eliminate amplification noise by counting the unique UMIs instead of the total reads at the end.\nNext, sequencing library is prepared. For Illumina sequencing, this involves fragmenting the cDNA into approximately 300 base pair fragments, followed by paired-end sequencing to generate two 100 base pair reads. Some sequencing facilities now offer protocols specifically optimized for 10X Genomics data, sequencing only the required lengths for each read. so in totality this is how scrna single read looks like shown in Figure¬†4 :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Image credit Tallulah Andrews Presentation, Andrews Computational Biology Lab: Structure of scRNA-seq reads\n\n\n\nBased on the above discussion, lets ask some question and then try to answer those.\nQ1: What would happen if the mRNA gets highly degraded before reverse transcription occurs?\nAns1: if the mRNA is degraded then their are several possible scenarios that works in connection with each other can be disrupted:\n\nFragmented mRNA may not include the entire sequence of the genes. This can lead to missing information for genes that are represented only by the degraded parts.\nThe sequencing library may become biased towards the more stable fragments of mRNA, potentially overrepresenting some parts of the transcriptome while underrepresenting others. This can skew the expression profiles.\nIncomplete cDNA Synthesis.\n\nQ2: What would happen if the wrong cell barcode whitelist is used ?\nAns2: This would cause alot of the reads to not match to any cell essentially resulting in throwing away 70 or 80% of reads because cell Ranger will not be able to map them to a cell.\nQ3: what would happen if their is a strong bias towards certain sequences when generating UMIs.\nAns3: The strong bias towards certains sequences would undercount the amount of mRNA molecules actually captured because we will get more mRNA molecules with the same UMI."

This step is crucial for identifying the origins of fragments especially RNA in the context of scRNA within each cell, enabling the quantification of gene or transcript expression levels. This step is usually computationally intensive in any high-throughput sequencing analysis.\nThe alignment process uses specialized algorithms to locate the positions of RNA reads on the reference genome, thus determining which genes are expressed and at what levels.\nThe output of this process typically includes several key files: an aligned reads file in BAM (Binary Alignment Map) or SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) format, which contains detailed information about the read sequences, their alignment positions, and mapping quality; a gene expression matrix in tabular format, which provides counts of reads or transcripts mapped to each gene for every single cell, essential for downstream analyses like identifying differentially expressed genes and clustering cells based on their gene expression profiles.\nSummary statistics that assess the quality of the alignment, including metrics such as the percentage of successfully aligned reads, the distribution of reads across genomic features, and overall coverage depth. Through alignment or mapping, researchers can accurately quantify gene expression at the single-cell level, facilitating insights into cellular heterogeneity and the discovery of novel cell types and states.\nAs of now, several tools has been developed to align or map scRNA reads to either reference transcriptome, genome or an augmented transcriptome. Tools like Cell Ranger (Zheng et al. 2017), zUMIs (Parekh et al. 2018), alevin (Srivastava et al. 2016), Raindrop (Niebler et al. 2020), kallisto Bustools (Melsted et al. 2021), STARsolo (Kaminow, Yunusov, and Dobin 2021), and Allevin fry (He et al. 2022) are some of the tools that have been extensively used to carry out alignment or mapping.\n\nDifferent reference sequences can be used for mapping. There are three main types of reference sequences:\n\nThe full, annotated reference genome.\nThe annotated transcriptome.\nMapping against an augmented transcriptome.\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs important to note that not all combinations of mapping algorithms and reference sequences are currently possible.

Additionally if you are working on mouse data then go to this link and you will find all the relevant information regarding mouse data. When mapping reads to transcriptome one needs to consider:\n\nIf a Knock-in mouse has a novel human gene inserted into its genome, it is necessary to add that gene to the reference genome to accurately quantify its expression.\nAnnotation quality needs to be considered, especially when working with non-model species. For mouse or human, this is generally not an issue. However, with non-model species, incomplete or inaccurate annotations can cause problems, particularly when sequencing only one end of the transcript. If many transcripts have long untranslated regions (UTRs) that have not been identified, it could result in the loss of a significant number of reads and genes. This is because many reads might not map to the annotated gene body. Therefore, it may be necessary to update the annotation if working with a less well-characterized genome of a non-typical species.\nConsider whether to include introns and exons or just exons. Previously, the answer was to use exons only for single-cell RNA sequencing and both introns and exons for single-nucleus RNA sequencing. However, now Cell Ranger includes both by default, as it captures 20% more reads even for single-cell RNA sequencing. There are also methods that utilize intronic versus exonic information, such as scVelo,(Soneson et al. 2021) which requires separate quantification of intron and exon reads.\nFor assigning reads to cells, the correct whitelist for cell barcodes is needed, and UMIs (unique molecular identifiers) are counted. One challenge is dealing with multi-mapping reads, where a read maps to multiple genes so which gene gets UMI count for that read. Cell Ranger‚Äôs current rule is to exclude all those reads that are multimapping, which can lead to an undercounting bias for genes with close homologs.\nCell Ranger also addresses sequencing errors in UMIs by allowing for up to one base pair error in the UMI sequence and correcting for it. While Cell Ranger is commonly used for 10x Genomics data, there are alternatives like STARsolo, which mimics Cell Ranger but is open-source and allows for easier modification of parameters.\nI‚Äôve been discussing sequencing errors, which might seem unusual to those familiar with sequencing technology, as it is typically 99.9% accurate these days. However, when I mention sequencing errors, I‚Äôm actually referring to all the errors that can occur from the mRNA molecules to our sequencing reads. Errors can arise from reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis, from DNA polymerase during sequence amplification, and from the sequencing machine itself. While the sequencing machine‚Äôs errors are very low, errors at other stages are not necessarily as minimal."

We produce these droplets by simultaneously flowing barcoded beads and cells, which are then encased in droplets by oil in our 10x Chromium machine as shown in Figure¬†6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: How droplets are generated\n\n\n\nThis process generates hundreds of droplets per second. Ideally, each droplet would contain one cell and one barcoded bead, but in reality, only about 5% of the droplets achieve this ideal condition. Additionally, all droplets contain ambient RNA. This occurs because some cells get damaged or break during handling and extraction from tissue, particularly when passing through microfluidic devices at high speeds. This results in RNA being released into the surrounding solution.\nWhen droplets are formed, they capture both the cells and the ambient RNA floating in the supernatant. Therefore, ambient RNA is present in nearly all droplets. In practice, about 95% of droplets are considered empty, with approximately 20% containing only ambient RNA. Around 7% of droplets will have a barcoded bead with capture nucleotides along with ambient RNA as shown in Figure¬†7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Possible droplets Configuration\n\n\n\nThis means the barcoded bead can capture ambient RNA, generate cDNA, and include unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that will appear in the sequencing library and subsequently in the sequencing data results.\nWhen ambient RNA is present at moderate to high levels, it can cause problems in later parts of the analyses for two main reasons:\n\nAmbient RNA can mix with the genuine gene expression profiles of cells, making it difficult to accurately identify cell types.\nDifferences observed between experimental conditions might be due to variations in ambient RNA levels rather than actual biological differences.\nFor the solution of this problem (Lun et al. 2019) proposed an efficient method in this paper and that cell Ranger Version 3 and above has adapted in their pipeline. For the detail method here is the link to the paper (Lun et al. 2019). The function emptydrops is embedded in DropletUtils R package. Another useful resource for When should I correct for ambient RNA?\n\n2nd Problem: Processed pseudogenes are mRNAs that have undergone reverse transcription within the cell and been reintegrated into the genome. They possess the entire exonic sequence but lack promoters, enhancers, or any regulatory elements, making them incapable of being expressed since transcription factors or RNA polymerase cannot bind to them.\nDespite this, we still detect them due to mismatched reads. Ideally, all reads should align with the gene that is actively transcribed, but a small portion of reads actually map to the processed pseudogene. This mismapping accounts for about 4% of the reads. Considering a 1% sequencing error rate, a 100 base pair read would result in approximately 4% of the reads having three or more sequencing errors, causing mismapping. This analysis only includes uniquely mapping genes, excluding multimapping reads.\nTo address this mismapping issue, the default genome provided by cellRanger masks all pseudogenes and processed pseudogenes. This masking is done to prevent errors caused by mismatched reads.\nDoublet Problem:\n\nDoublets in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) arise when two cells are captured together in the same droplet or well during the encapsulation process as shown in Figure¬†7. Multiple cells with multiple beads but that is less common.\nDoublets are divided further into two categories:\nHeterotypic Doublets: When one bead capture two different cells where one could be an epithelial cell and one could be a T-cell.\nHomotypic Doublets: When one bead capture two same cells, where both the cell are of the same type such as T-cells.\nSadly, at this stage we cannot do anything about homotypic doublet and this is an active area of research. Andrews Computation Biology Lab is working actively on this side of the single cell and ambient RNA as well. Anyone interested in this can go and check out their lab.\nBut their are a bunch of tools that have been developed which works efficiently on identifying these heterotypic doublets i.e Doublet finder, Scrublet.\n\nBe ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity: Horace Mann"
